# Pig Game

This is the Project #3 of the course 'The Complete JavaScript Course 2024: From Zero to Expert!' by Jonas Schmedtmann.

This project is a game, with two players, and the goal is roll a dice, hold the score and the first player to reach 100 points wins the game.

The purpose of this project is to reinforce all the skills learned up until this point, specially DOM manipulation and the DRY principle.
